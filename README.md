# FCND - Drone Flyer Project
Abstract: In this project, I will set up a state machine using event-driven programming to autonomously flying a drone. I will be using flying a quadcopter in Unity simulator. 
## Step 1: Download the Simulator
download the version of the simulator that's appropriate for your operating system [from this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).

## Task
